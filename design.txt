Rooms

When spawning a new room, call the init_room function and give the correct room data as a parameter
(these are in the room_data dict inside the RoomData script). That's all!

If a room is picked up and then put down near or on top of another room, the check_connector_snap()
method inside room.gd is called to see if the room connectors are close enough to connect. If not,
the room cannot be put down there.


RoomData (IMPORTANT!)

Remember to change the room_shape_dimensions dict if you resize the rooms!

Add some offset to connector placements in the room_connectors dict, so the rooms are not adjacent when snapped.
Otherwise, room area detection does not work because the room areas are too close together!
