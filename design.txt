TODO:
	1. Life support room (at some point, makes testing harder)
	2. Airlock room (must have one of these that is not leading to a courtyard at all times)
	3. Empty/isolation room or hallway (does nothing, some other rooms must be isolated from the rest of the ship using this)



ROOMS

When spawning a new room, call the init_room function and give the correct room data as a parameter
(these are in the room_data dict inside the RoomData script). That's all!

Rooms always spawn UNACTIVATED. Note that a lit up room means that the room is ACTIVATED:
powered rooms can be dark if they are still UNACTIVATED (although this might not ever happen?).

Rooms can be set to be always activated. These rooms are activated automatically once they are connected, and cannot be deactivated.
Rooms with a power usage of 0 can never be powered, but they can be activated as usual.

If a room is picked up and then put down near or on top of another room, the connect_rooms()
method inside room.gd is called to see if the room connectors are close enough to connect. If not,
the room cannot be put down there.

If the room can be connected, it is, and the room_connected signal is emitted. Each room will listen to
this signal, and if the connectors in the emitted signal match their own connectors, they will react
accordingly. Everything that needs to be done AFTER rooms have been placed should therefore be in
the _on_room_connected function inside room.gd.



RoomData (IMPORTANT!)

Lots of stuff in RoomData should probably be moved elsewhere and reimplemented,
for example each room shape could have its own scene since there should not be that
many of them and it would be much better to see the rooms visually.

Remember to change the room_shape_dimensions dict if you resize the rooms!

Add some offset to connector placements in the room_connectors dict, so the rooms are not adjacent when snapped.
Otherwise, room area detection does not work because the room areas are too close together!



CREATING A NEW ROOM TYPE:
	1. Add the new room type (e.g. MY_ROOM) to the RoomType enum in RoomData.gd.
	(If the new room has a new, non-existing shape as well, add the shape to the RoomShape enum)
	2. Create a data dict for the room, e.g. _my_room_data = {}
	3. Add RoomType.MY_ROOM: _my_room_data to the room_data dict.
	4. If you created a new shape, update room_info_pos and
	room_connectors appropriately.
	5. Finally, if you created a new shape, add a polygon representing it to the "AllRoomShapes"
	node inside the Room scene, and update the (_ready(), create_clickable_area()) function in room.gd accordingly.
	(This should be simplified!)



FOLDER STRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT

The "room" folder has everything that is related to a single room: the room scene, the connector scene etc.
There's also the  "RoomConnections" script, which holds functions related to connecting rooms or checking distances etc.
(These are not in room.gd mainly to not make that script too lengthy)
